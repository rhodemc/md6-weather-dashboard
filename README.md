## Description

<!-- I was motivated to create a work day scheduler because I feel work is optimized when the day is pre-planned.

Using this work day scheduler allows for quick saving of to-dos in hour time-blocks. It's a great resource for people who have trouble organizing their workflow.

When using this work day scheduler, you'll find responsive save buttons, a clock that displays accurate date and time when refreshed and color highlights based on that time. -->

## Usage

<!-- To enjoy this site, type in your to-do items into each time block and click the save button. Each block will show a color depending on the time: grey if already passed, red if in the present hour and green if scheduled in the future. Your to-do items will save even if the page is refreshed. -->
